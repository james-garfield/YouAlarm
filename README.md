# YouAlarm

Have you ever wanted to wake up to your favourite song? I recently got a Google Pixel 6 and with it, a free 7 day subscription to YoutubeMusic.
With that subscription in my hands I could wake up to whatever song I wanted to listen to. But alas, I didn't want to use the app. So I decided to write this little app that would allow me to do that. It is very simple. It dosen't look very nice, but it gets the job done. 

## Important
This app currently only works for Android devices.

## Getting Started
If you know how to use Flutter then you can build this app as you like. Otherwise, you can follow the instructions below.

## Installing
Download the app.apk file and install it on your Android device.
